I just finished the game, Overlord Escape from Nazarick. I was playing the SWITCH version, and I would like to make some notes.

<!-- more -->

The first thing is the map. This is the map I drawed manually, it is svg file with CC0 license.

<div style="max-width: 100%;" class="img-row">{% asset_img overlord-escape_from_nazarick-map.svg %}</div>

If you want the map without grid lines: {% asset_link overlord-escape_from_nazarick-map-no_lines.svg %}

TODO: add location for all memory fragments.
