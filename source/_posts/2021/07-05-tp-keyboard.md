Conclusion: I had bought a Thinkpad TrackPoint Keyboard 2 yesterday (2021 July 4th), it works well on my Macbook Pro. I don't find a way to adjust scroll direction (becase I enabled Natural scroll direction for built-in trackpad). Except this. I would like to say: it works perfect.

My configuration

  * Mac OS X 11.4 Big Sur
  * Macbook Pro 15-inch 2019, Intel Core i9

Test result

* ✅ Bluetooth connection has no problem
* ✅ 2.4G connection has no problem
* ✅ Fn key has no problem
* ✅ TrackPoint has no problem

When pairing TP keyboard to MBP, do not forget to input Pin code. If you don't like the default key mapping, [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) will help you a lot. Inlcudes switching key layout, or disabling TrackPoint middle key.

Pressing `Fn` + `Esc` to enable FnLock, then you could use Function keys as usual.

Since I enabled Natural scroll direction in MBP for its built-in trackpad, using TrackPoint for scrolling will apply opposit direction, and I haven't found a way to address this issue. But this is not big deal for me.
