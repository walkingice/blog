It is funny that there were lots of Japanese languae learner were asking the meaning of "交通規則を逃げろ(にげろ)", but every japanese native speaker answers "this sentence doesn't make sense".

<!-- more -->

But, why there were so many learners asking same question?

<div style="max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">{% asset_img pic_1.jpg %}</div>

Because they all used みなの日本語II as text book. In page. 62 you will find this example

<div style="max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">{% asset_img pic_2.jpg %}</div>

The answer is quite simple: We misinterpreted the format.

<div style="max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">{% asset_img pic_3.jpg %}</div>

Wrong

1. 交通規則を逃げろ
1. 交通規則をまもれ

Correct

1. 逃げろ
1. 交通規則をまもれ

Oh, yes, I made the same mistake yesterday, haha!
